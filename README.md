# Securing-DNS-using-Image-Encryption
The “Securing DNS using Image Encryption” is a project that is designed to mainly fill the loopholes that are existing in the present DNS security. The project is intended to give more protection to the domain names as they contain the sensitive information of the company. Also they are highly prone to attacks and there is a chance of data being corrupted or being lost. So, in order to reduce the effects of these attacks, we designed this project using steganography and image encryption. In this we hide the domain name in an Image using Steganography. The image is then encrypted using AES 256 algorithm along with a password. The password used is then encrypted with receiver’s public key using RSA  algorithm. Now both the encrypted image(PNG) and the cipher text(.txt) are sent to the receiver.On receiving the encrypted image and cipher text,receiverdeciphersthe cipher text using his private key which gives password. Using this deciphered password, the encrypted image is decrypted by the receiver and could extract the necessary information present on the original image.
